# Demos

The demos in this directory will walk you through:

- ML model container generation using the `octoml` CLI
- Container deployment and inference locally via docker
- Container deployment and inference via Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

Three example model setups are provided for you to play with:

```
- vision/                 -- A classification vision model in ONNX to detect whether a cat is bringing in prey
- question_answering/    -- BERT in ONNX, using the huggingface transformers library for pre and post processing
- generation/             -- GPT2 in ONNX, calling into the huggingface transformers library for generation at runtime
```

## Setup Environment

In this section we will validate the environment and install some dependencies. Make sure you've globally installed the OctoML CLI, by moving the CLI binary to an appropriate location like `/usr/local/bin` or adding it to your `$PATH`.

Verify you have the `octoml` cli installed:

```shell
$ octoml -V
octoml 0.2.4 (d5d534e 2022-05-14 23:38:45)
```

Verify you have python installed. You need Python3. Python3.10 users (e.g. Ubuntu Jammy) see our [Note on Python3.10](#todo)

```shell
$ python --version
Python 3.8.4
```

Verify you have a running docker daemon:

```shell
docker ps
```

Clone the tutorials repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/octoml/octoml-cli-tutorials
cd octoml-cli-tutorials
cd tutorials
```

We recommend that you use a Python virtual environment:

```shell
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Run setup utility to install the python dependencies.

```shell
./setup.sh
```

> Note: The following steps assume that your current working directory is one of the listed example model dirs above. Let's `cd` into the `vision` repository for example. 

Change Directory into the vision tutorial:

```
$ cd vision
$ ls
cat_input_images/  critterblock.onnx  octoml.yaml  run.py
```

## Local inference without a container

Before deploying this model to a production-scale microservice, let's make sure we can run a single inference locally on our model:

```
$ python3 run.py --local

Cat score: 1.000
Approach score: 1.000
Prey score: 0.999
--------------------------------------
```

The `critterblock.onnx` model is a Computer Vision (Resnet-based) model customized for a cat door; the door stays closed when it detects that a cat is carrying its prey and opens when the cat is not. In `run.py`, we pass in a sample image to the model, run image preprocessing code customized for this use case, run an inference using ONNX Runtime, and finally call image post-processing code on the results of the model. The script returns a cat score of 1, approach score of 1, and prey score of 0.999 on this image, which means the model correctly detected that a cat is approaching the cat door while holding its prey.


## Generate production-scale deployment using OctoML CLI

Now that we've confirmed the model is working as intended, let's prepare it for production-scale usage. We will deploy the package locally using the OctoML CLI without having to upload our models to the OctoML platform.

The `octoml.yaml` file has been created for you already:

```
$ cat octoml.yaml
---
models:
  critterblock:
    path: critterblock.onnx
```

Now use this file to generate a docker image and start a docker container running triton -- this will deploy a docker container locally on your machine.

```
$ octoml deploy
 ∙∙∙ Models imported
 ∙∙∙ Packages generated
 ∙∙∙ Docker image assembled
 ∙∙∙ Triton image built
 ∙∙∙ 🐳 Triton container started

A docker container with a triton inference server is now running on your local
machine. For more information about how to interact with your model, please
refer to our tutorials and guides on GitHub.

https://github.com/octoml/octoml-cli-tutorials
```

After running the command above, you can verify that a Docker container has been spun up successfully by running `docker ps`.

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED      STATUS      PORTS                              NAMES
7182ac8ee475   a85ac5657dc0   "/opt/tritonserver/n…"   3 days ago   Up 3 days   0.0.0.0:8000-8002->8000-8002/tcp   vengeful-coach
```

## Confirm that we can run inferences on the container locally.

By default, the running Docker container exposes a GRPC endpoint at port 8001. The
following invocation will run the client code for sending a sample inference request
to that default port. `run.py` contains client code for the deployed docker container.

```
$ python3 run.py --triton

Cat score: 1.000
Approach score: 1.000
Prey score: 0.999
--------------------------------------
```

Again, we see a cat score of 1, approach score of 1, and prey score of 0.999 on our sample image. This means our containerized model is working as intended.

## Kubernetes Deployment

Now that we have a production-grade container ready for deployment, let's deploy the container to an existing EKS cluster.
EKS is AWS's Kubernetes service for production scale services

> Note: the following steps assume the following have already been configured:

- An AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for pushing built docker images to
- An EKS cluster with a node pool for c5n.xlarge instances that has a no_schedule taint for `octoml.ai/octomizer-platform: aws-c5n.xlarge`
- nginx-ingress for above EKS cluster
- IAM access to the EKS cluster


Navigate one level back up to the tutorials repo. 

```shell
$ cd ..
$ ls
README.md  deploy_to_eks.sh  generation  helm_chart  question_answering  requirements.txt  setup-cloud.sh  setup.sh  vision
```

> Note: The following script requires `kubectl`, `helm`, and `aws` to be installed. You can run `./setup-cloud.sh` to install them. This requires `sudo`.

Install cloud utilities (if needed):

```
./setup-cloud.sh
```

Run the following script to push our local container to an AWS ECR repo and install a sample helm chart to the EKS cluster.


```./deploy_to_eks.sh <model_name> <aws_profile_name> <docker_image_tag_you_want_to_push> <aws_registry_url> <aws_cluster_name> <aws_region>```

For example:

```./deploy_to_eks.sh critterblock 186900524924_Sandbox-Developer critterblockv5 186900524924.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com octoml-sandbox-sxq590bv us-west-2```

## Inference on Cloud

Finally, run inferences on the container deployed to EKS

The last step of the `deploy_to_eks.sh` script port-forwards the EKS deployment's triton GRPC endpoint to localhost

```kubectl port-forward service/<model_name> -n <model_name> 8080:80```

Now we can run inference:

```python run.py --triton --port 8080```

To clean up the environment or if you want to try other live demos on EKS, kill the port-forward script and run:

```helm uninstall demo```

## Troubleshooting

To check for Kubernetes deployment info, run

```kubectl get all -n demo```

To get the logs for a failed pod deployment, run the above and modify the pod name below in the following command:

```kubectl logs pod/demo-6f45998bbb-6jnlq -n demo```
